1. Explain your Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) experience.
Answer:
In my current role, I follow the STLC phases:
Requirement Analysis – Reviewing business/functional requirements, clarifying gaps with stakeholders.
Test Planning – Preparing test strategy, estimating effort, identifying tools, defining entry/exit criteria.
Test Case Design – Writing detailed test cases and preparing test data.
Test Execution – Executing tests, logging defects, retesting and regression testing.
Defect Reporting & Tracking – Logging defects with detailed steps, severity, and priority in JIRA.
Test Closure – Preparing metrics (defect density, pass/fail rate, requirement coverage) and retrospective analysis.
